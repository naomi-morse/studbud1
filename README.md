# Development Documentation
In designing and coding this website, I considered a range of design patterns and principles to ensure ultimate usability and accessibility. For example, the buttons and input boxes are easy to identify as the contrast of the bright blue creates a clear call-to-action. Furthermore, I ensured that there were prompts for when the user hovered over certain elements (e.g. a box shadow).  I also kept (relatively) large fonts, to help with the accessibility of my website.  

After designing my website’s mock-ups, I created the website prototype (this website). Iterations were made based on user feedback, as well as self-reflection and further refinement. This ensured a more usable, accessible, and clear website that successfully facilitates the goals of the charity.

## Design changes and iterations
Users said that the website was a “little bit squished”, meaning that there was not enough breathing space between each element. To overcome this limitation, I added larger margins and padding to ensure greater white space. This also made the information more digestible to read and understand.

For the tasklist, on the task management page, users found it a bit too crowded and confusing to use. This was because the kanban section was horizontal/next to the task list. Therefore, after reflection, I decided to place the task list section underneath the kanban board. This allowed for greater emphasis on both individual sections, as it enabled me to make the task lsit larger. Furthermore, it was easier for me to create input boxes (the form) if it was underneath the kanban board. Thus, I was not extremely confident in my ability to create the tasklist where it was originally meant to be in the mock-up. Therefore, this iteration made them stack vertically. This is much easier to navigate, as there is more space for each element.

Users liked the simplicity of the time page, as it was straight forward and easy to use. Thus, I maintained the simple visuals and limited stylistic features on this page. I decided to get rid of the circle indicating progress. Although this was useful, I did not want to complicate the page too much. Furthermore, I decided not to do two different colours (blue and red) as I wanted to keep all buttons consistently styled throughout the whole document. Users got confused if the red buttons were clickable or not. Feedback indicated that users found it easier when all the buttons had the same stylistic features. Additionally, users wanted a static navigation bar. Many users were confused as to where the navigation bar (in the original mock-up) went. Therefore, I decided to add the side bar navigation back into the time page.

Additionally, for the content/reading list page, I changed it from being two pages, into one. This means that I got rid of the folder structure on the first page, as I was not confident in my technical abilities. 

## Next steps
 In the next iteration, I would include more stylistic features throughout the entire website. I found that the design was quite boring, and would benefit from more fun and engaging visuals. I would also develop the reading lisk pages more to create folders of links for different subjects etc. I did not feel confident in my own technical abilities to create something like this. However, if I gave myself more time, I could explore and possibly create this. This would be useful for students to better organise their reading material, instead of it all being in the same long list. Finally, I would definitely develop my music page more, as it is not very effective. I would like to implement javascript to create a more usable and efficient website, that ensures maximum usability.
