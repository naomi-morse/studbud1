# Development Documentation
In designing and coding this website, I considered a range of design patterns and principles to ensure ultimate usability and accessibility. For example, the buttons and input boxes are easy to identify as the contrast of the bright blue creates a clear call-to-action. Furthermore, I ensured that there were prompts for when the user hovered over certain elements (e.g. a box shadow).  I also kept (relatively) large fonts, to help with the accessibility of my website.  

After designing my websiteâ€™s mock-ups, I created the website prototype (this website). Iterations were made based on user feedback, as well as self-reflection and further refinement. This ensured a more usable, accessible, and clear website that successfully facilitates the goals of the charity.
